Github webhooks integration
===========================

Kanboard can be synchronized with Github.
Currently, it's only a one-way synchronization: Github to Kanboard.

Github webhooks are plugged to Kanboard automatic actions.
When an event occurs on Github, an action can be performed on Kanboard.

List of available events
------------------------

- Github commit received
- Github issue opened
- Github issue closed
- Github issue reopened
- Github issue assignee change
- Github issue label change
- Github issue comment created

List of available actions
-------------------------

- Create a task from an external provider
- Change the assignee based on an external username
- Change the category based on an external label
- Create a comment from an external provider

Configuration on Github
-----------------------

Go to your project settings page, on the left choose "Webhooks & Services", then click on the button "Add webhook".

Each time an event happens, Github will send an event to Kanboard now.
The Kanboard webhook url is protected by a random token.

Everything else is handled by automatic actions in your Kanboard project settings.

Examples
--------

### Close a Kanboard task when a commit pushed to Github

- Choose the event: **Github commit received**
- Choose the action: **Close the task**

When one or more commits are sent to Github, Kanboard will receive the information, each commit message with a task number included will be closed.

- That will close the Kanboard task #1234
